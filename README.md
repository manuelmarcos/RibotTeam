RibotTeam
=========

RibotTeam is an iPhone App that has a list of ribot team members, with the option to tap through to see their details.

It uses a Rest API and could have been implemented with the [restKit](https://github.com/RestKit/RestKit) for iOS. However, I considered that this project is not big enough to use such a heavy framework.

Additionally, this project has been set up for a potential iPad app. It already has some settings and code, and would be quite simple to extend the project for iPad implementation.

Requirements:
============

In order to install this application into your iPhone or simulator you need:

   Xcode 4.6 or later

   iPhone device or iPhone simulator with iOS 6.1
   

Tips to follow the code:
=======================

FIND CLASSES: 
A good tip to find classes is have a look at the Navigation view (on the left hand side of Xcode) 
where I have organized the classes depending on their type.

FIND METHODS: 
"pragma marks" is a very useful feature in Xcode when we are navigating within a class.

We can find them here:

![alt tag](http://emiliaregalado.com/ribotChallenge/pragmaMarkClick.png)

Once we have clicked there, we will be able to see the list of pragma marks that this class has.
Each pragma mark has a list of methods

WHAT DO THEY DO? 
In order to make our lives easier, I have commented every method, following this protocol:


* CALLED: it tells us when this method could be called
* IN: What parameters the method gets
* OUT: What parameters the method returns
* DO: What the method does

The last tip is about Debug info.
If we open **RibotTeam-Prefix.pch** we could see that we have defined a DEBUG flag for print out info through Xcode console. In this case, whenever the App is ready for distribution we will only have to change that flag instead of removing all the debug info.


Navigation:
==========

We are going to have a look at the project in more detail. To do so, we will explain each group in the navigation view of the project in xcode.

--> Go to RibotTeam.xcodeproj--> RibotTeam --> **MVC**
Once we are there, we have another three folders:
   * MODEL 
   * VIEW 
   * CONTROLLER. 

They implement the logic of our application.

Model
-----

**Employee.h/.m** is our managed object which is a generic class that implements all the basic behavior required of a Core Data model object.

**RibotTeam.xcdatamodeld** is our data base.

View
----

**RBTPoppingView.h/.m** is a subclass of UIView. This custom view has some animations in order to "POP" the view.

As we said at the beginning, we have already set up few settings for iPad development but we are not going to talk about them in this project.
--> Go to "iPhone" folder

**RBTMasterViewController_iPhone.xib**  represents our table view which is the first view to be displayed.

**RBTDetailViewController_iPhone.xib**  represents our detail view which will display the details of each ribot team member.

Controller
----------

**RBTMasterViewController.h/.m** is our first controller to be loaded. It deals (insert/edit/delete) with the Model (Employee.h/.m) and displays content in the view (RBTMasterViewController_iPhone.xib)

**RBTDetailViewController.h/.m** navigates from RBTMasterViewController.h/.m and displays the details of each ribot team member. It also deals with Employee.h/.m and displays the content into RBTDetailViewController_iPhone.xib




Now, -> Go to RibotTeam.xcodeproj--> RibotTeam --> **Resources**


Resources
---------
This folder has another six folders more: 
   
   * **Categories** An Objective-C category allows us to add methods to an existing class—effectively subclassing it without having to deal with the possible complexities of subclassing.
   
      * UIColor+UIColor_HexColor.h/.m is a category of UIColor and it implements a method that changes HexColors into UIColors
      * UIImage+OverlayTintColor.h/.m is a category of UIImage and it overlays a UIColor on top of a PNG image. Basically, it paints a PNG with a given UIColor. 
      
   * **Operations**
   
      * RBTDownloadOperation.h/.m is a subclass of NSOperation and it implements a protocol that will make our life easier when dealing with NSURLRequest. We will use it to communicate with the API. We have to be careful when we use it cos it adds the operation to the operation queue of the mainthread but does not guarantee when it will be executed. There could be other items in that queue still waiting to execute so we will have to make sure in which Thread we are when we want to change the UI.
      
   * **Maps**
   
      * RBTAnnotationMap.h/.m is just a MKAnnotation protocol which, is used to provide annotation-related information to a map view. In this case, the location of the ribot team member.
    
   * **Reachability** It demonstrates how to know when IP can be routed and when traffic will be routed through a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN) interface such as EDGE or 3G.

   * **SDWebImage** We can find this library [here](https://github.com/rs/SDWebImage). It is a great library for downloading web images asynchronously.
  
   * **Assets**
   
      * Most of the assets are available for retina and non-retina display.

**SystemConfiguration.framework** contains interfaces for determining the network configuration of a device.




Improvements & Evaluation
=========================

There are four main things in the design that I would like to improve but I haven´t had time to do.
   
   * **Instruments** and **RibotTeamTests** I wanted to use these Xcode tools. It helps you finding memory leaks and testing the App.

   * **PoppingView** is one of them. This view is being added on top of the table view instead of the actual view and that is why it could look broken if you scroll down. We have to change the **RBTMasterViewController_iPhone.xib** in order to do this. It is not a major change but it will affect to the controller **RBTMasterViewController**

   * **RBTDetailViewController_iPhone.xib** I would like to make this view scrollable because at the moment I am resizing the label font size in order to fit them into the frame given. Basically, I would like to make dinamic sizes for the label frames. In this case, the text size will be always the same. Also, if we do not have a description, instead of displaying "No description" we will not display it and the view will be resized.  

   * **Twitter** Instead of open the App, integrate the twitter framework into it.
   
There are more improvements that I would like to do... such as create Localizable.String for different languages... or an email composer... or ribotars in full screen... or an iPad App... 

Lastly, I did a small research at the beginning in order to compare different applications which, do the same as ribotTeam, and make the right decisions for: 
   * Project template: It is a Master-Detail template. Such as Twitter App, Contacts (Native App), Notes (Native App) ...
   * App Icon: It just has a letter and a color. Simple and clear like google App, Vine App, Wikipedia App, tumblr App ... 
   * Launch screen: It is an empty table view. Such as twitter App, notes App, foursquare App ...

I am quite happy with the result, It is colorful and smooth. Hope you enjoy it too!!!
